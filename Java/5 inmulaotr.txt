immutable can'nt change data
string is inmutable,as it is pointing same refernce because if it chng it create new object 
store in pool(located in heap)

String s1 = "hh"
String s2 = s1 + "ab"
String s3 = "hh"

3 objects == hh , ab , s1+ab
cant create new instance of object if it value already present

TASK : make immutable class and explain it
