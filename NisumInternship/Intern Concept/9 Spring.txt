Spring is framework dont construct object we will do it for you 

*Dependency Injection : laptop[ram,harddrive...] all are from different
object depend on another object means every thing is not depend 

Loose Coupling : one obj not depent on other object [harddrive company can change]

but we are here using new call Tight Coupling

*Depedency inj container ; responisble to create object to you then inject in your class

in xml we define if some want harddrive give him this harddrive

@componet : genrated when requiered

now how laptop say that he want harddisk
@Autowire : mention that i want harddrive 

HardDrive obj = new HitachiDrive();
equals
@Autowired
HardDrive obj

spring framwork connect autowired with component coonection is autuwired

why :   we want loose coupling
	help in testing we test class without effect other thing



MAVEN : build tool, jar file , you just tell maven required file
	pom.xml = where you mention maven about requierd files

unique for the world
GroupId = define project [com.nisum]
ArtifaceId = represnt project name [demo]
