== check references points to same location 
equalto() check values of object, it is overriden
hashCode integer value associated with each object

same/equal objects have same hash code

if hashCode are equal then it doesnt mean objects are also equal
but if objects are equal then hash must also same 

we want to override either both of them or neither of them
beacuse if we override equals() and doesnot over hashCode() then the
hash of both object are not same and here we are breaking rules vice versa


reflexive: a == a -> true
symmetric: a==b && b==a -> true
transitive: a==b && b==c -> a==c
consistent: equal should work with consistent mean every time return true until vaule are not chnge

hash(Object... values) : can take n numbers of object
