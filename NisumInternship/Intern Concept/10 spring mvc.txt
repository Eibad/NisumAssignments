Spring MVC : 

Controller (Dispacther Servlet)
all request goto front controller
dispacther thing i want to call login controller as the request is of Login

client->request to->web xml file-> dispacher [need config file where define]


every controller have mapping by @controller
controller return a page/view ; data genrated by controller

every thing is done by dispatcher

why? ; in future you just chng config file just


multiple controller under single controller


JSTL : jakarta standard tag library ; tag library for designing in html
import by using <%@ taglib 

@modelAttribute = bind model populated with data from form
@requestMApping = map web request to spring controller methods
@requestMApping(value ="") = 
Model = object,supply attrbiute use for rendering views
JdbcTemplate = class,main API through which we access most functionaltity like create
DAO = data access object,sql queries , sperate data rescoure from data acess
Bean = public reusable, encapsule many object in one object
web.xml = config file , define mapping between urls and servlet
@pathvariable = 

template working from bean ?


href="<path of request mapping>"



** SPRING CONFIG ** 
web-inf -> web.xml
configuration of dispatcher sevlet:
define disapcther servlet class -> dispatch request by himself
map with "/" ->forward all request to dispacher

spring config:
web-inf ->spring-servlet.xml

schemas declare
beans tag has schemas

from where our component scan ->it scall all class
view resolver -> view of all application (.jsp)
data source -> database config


localsession factory -> for hibernate  -> anootated class define all entity

hibernate template -> give reference of factory = use for perfrom operation with database


hibernateTranstion manger -> to autmotaticaly manage transaction = we need trastion for wtrite opeartion



** MAKE DAO **
class which contact with database
@Component = spring mangange life cycle of object
@autowired hiberante = spring mvc bring object of hibernate from spring config
